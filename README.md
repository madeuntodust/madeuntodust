# A better Stargate wiki

This is a wiki detailing the various plots in Stargate, the MGM-owned science fiction franchise.

Other fan sites for the Stargate franchise are clunky and confusing. They cite little-known novels written by obscure authors that were allowed by MGM to use the Stargate branding.

Made Unto Dust is supposed to be a short and easy-to-read wiki that is an easy companion for watching the television show and introducing your friends to the franchise.

### What we consider canon

This wiki only considers the followin television shows and films to be canon:
* The 1994 Stargate movie
* Stargate SG-1
* Stargate: Atlantis
* Stargate: Universe
* Stargate: The Ark of Truth
* Stargate: Continuum

The following are deliberaly not considered canon, given their tendency to contradict or complicate the plots in the above television shows and films:
* Stargate: Origins
* Stargate: Infinity
* All Stargate novels, video games, tabletop games
* Any film or television show not listed in the first list
